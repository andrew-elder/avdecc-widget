/**

 *
 * Public CLOCK DOMAIN descriptor response interface class
 * The CLOCK DOMAIN descriptor describes a source of a common clock signal within an
 * AVDECC Entity. This could be the output from a PLL, which can be locked to a
 * number of sources or a clock signal generator. The CLOCK DOMAIN allows for the
 * selection of the CLOCK SOURCE of the domain and determines what the valid
 * sources are for the domain.
