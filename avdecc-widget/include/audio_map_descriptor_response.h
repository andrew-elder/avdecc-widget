/**
 * audio_map_descriptor_response.h
 *
 * Public Audio Map descriptor response interface class
 * The Audio Map descriptor describes a static mapping between an audio stream's channels
 * and an audio cluster's channels for streams and stream ports which are located in the
 * same clock domain. An AVDECC Entity which supports dynamic mappings, that is mappings
 * which can be changed at runtime by an AVDECC Controller, does not use Audio Map
 * descriptors, but instead provides their mappings via the GET_AUDIO_MAP command.
